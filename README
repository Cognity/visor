Building: the agent is build with maven.

```
usage: de.uniulm.omi.monitoring.MonitoringAgent
 -ip,--localIp <arg>      IP of the local machine
  -kip,--kairosUrl         Url of the kairosDB
 -kp,--kairosPort <arg>   Port of the kairosDB
 -p, --port <arg>         Port of the telnet server
```

The monitoring agent starts a small telnet server on either the default port 9002 or the port specified via the -p option.
Communication with the port is line based:
applicationName metricName value timestamp\n

applicationName: the name of the application reporting the metric
metricName: the name of the metric you want to report
value: the value of the metric
timestamp: unix timestamp of the measurement
